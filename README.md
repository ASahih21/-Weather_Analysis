# Module 6 - World Weather Analysis
This repositoriy  contains a series of jupyter notebook files that demonstrate usage of multiple REST APIs to get weather and location based data, and display a Google map using the [jupyter-gmaps]("https://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/") package.  APIs and python packages used include:

* jupyter-gmaps python package
* requests python package
* OpenWeatherMap REST API
* Google Maps REST APIs
    * Places API
    * Directions API
    
    
## Results

A  roadtrip through the central states at a refreshing summer temperatures.

## Challenges

Formatting latitude and longitudes for input into the API requests, and which python environment to use jupyterto get citipy/gmaps to function as intended. PyCharm could not display output figures with GMAPS. Jupyter Notebook could not call 'citipy' for an unknown reason, but other environments could.
